- 👋 Hi, I’m @haleycabaniss
- 🌋 I’m a physical volcanologist who uses numerical modeling as a tool to address variability in crustal stresses that influence the formation, migration, evolution and eruption of melt at the Earth's surface. My work has combined observations from geophysics, geochemistry and geology to study <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL077393">timescales of magma accumulation</a>, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL077393">tectonic controls on eruption</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67043-0">relationships between seismicity, deformation and eruption,</a>, and <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/959107">fault modulated eruptions</a>. I am particularly interested in rift related volcanism, and this has naturally inspired my interests in mid-ocean ridge processes and seafloor stability.
- 🎓 I received my BS in Geology from the College of Charleston, and my PhD at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I'm currently working for Eastern Kentucky University as an Assistant Professor of Geology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about neural networks and image recognition for application to my marine science research. I'm also excited to be developing my first iteration of an Applied Geophysics class, and am learning how to best teach these concepts to undergraduate students!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research related to volcanic deformation, finite element modeling of the solid Earth processes that govern volcanoes, and research related to mid-ocean ridge systems.
